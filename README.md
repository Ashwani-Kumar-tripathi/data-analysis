Tesla and GME Data Fetching and Visualization with Python

Overview
This project focuses on fetching stock price data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) from public APIs or web scraping, and visualizing trends using Python.
It demonstrates the full pipeline from data retrieval to analysis and visualization.
The tools used include requests for API calls, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for plotting.

Features
Data Fetching for TSLA and GME: Retrieve stock data for Tesla and GameStop from public APIs using requests.
Web Scraping (if required): Scrape stock data directly from websites using BeautifulSoup if APIs are not available.
Data Cleaning and Analysis: Process the fetched data using pandas to ensure it's ready for analysis.
Data Visualization: Create time-series visualizations (line charts, bar charts, etc.) using matplotlib to showcase stock price trends for TSLA and GME.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ashwani-Kumar-tripathi/data-analysis.git
cd data-analysis

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or install manually:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib

Usage
Fetching Data: The script fetches real-time stock price data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using APIs or scrapes the data from websites if necessary.
Cleaning Data: After fetching, the data is cleaned using pandas to handle missing values and ensure proper formatting.
Visualizing Data: The processed data is visualized using matplotlib, displaying key trends such as stock price fluctuations over time.

Run the Project
To fetch the data and generate visualizations, run the main script:
python main.py
You can modify the script to update the data source or customize the visualizations.
